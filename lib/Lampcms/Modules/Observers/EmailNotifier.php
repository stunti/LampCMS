/**
 * This class is an observer
 * It monitors events that trigger
 * sending out of emails to users
 * who are subscribed to certain things.
 *
 * For example users who follow specific tag
 * will all be sent emails telling them that
 * a new question with that tag has been added.
 *
 * The sending our of emails is done via the shutdown_function
 * which means that it will not delay the rendering of the page
 * that posted the event. Even the find() from the database
 * will be done inside the shutdown function just in case
 * the find() takes longer than a couple of seconds, it will
 * never affect the page rendering time
 *
 * Of cause for this to work the php must be running as
 * a fastcgi controlled by php fpm which is part of php 5.3.X
 * Talk to me if you need clarification on this one
 * Ask your question at http://support.lampcms.com
 *
 *
 * @todo For a super busy and popular site
 * that has over 10,000 followers for some
 * tags or for some users this class has to be re-written to run
 * very differently.
 *
 * Basically such sites should have separate dedicated server
 * for sending out mass emails. The most efficient way then would
 * be to invoke the script on that other server and only pass
 * the params there. So the notifyTagFollowers
 * will just be invoking the remore script
 * and passing comma separated list
 * of tags as param
 * notifyUserFollowers will be invoking remote script and passing
 * userID of user as just one param.
 *
 * That remote script will
 * konw what to do it will normally do this:
 * get own cursor, get that huge number of results like maybe 25000 followers
 * and then send then in chunks of 1000 and sleep 2 minutes in between
 * It's perfectly fine for one script to take sometimes 1 hours to send out such
 * large number of emails.
 *
 * Another possible way to do this is to just add
 * the email notification jobs to the
 * PENDING_NOTIFICATIONS collection as
 * a nested object via $addToSet operation of Mongo
 *
 * @todo The dedicated server will periodically check
 * that collection and will pop the notifications off
 * the nested array and process them.
 * This is probably a very effective way to deal
 * with frequent notifications and where notification
 * jobs can potentially jobs that need to send very large
 * number of emails - like when a user or topic is followed
 * by tens of thousands of other users.
 * This type of solution will not require invoking
 * a remote script, instead a remove server will be
 * checking the PENDING_NOTIFICATIONS collection
 * via cron script
 * In order for this to work you need to extend this class
 * and the factory() must return the instance of
 * that sub-class instead of this class.
 *
 * @todo more all the email and subject templates
 * into the I18N class when such class is ready
